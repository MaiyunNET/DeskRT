### CDN (recommend)

Recommended: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/deskrt@2.0.1/dist/loader.min.js (Less than 3kb minified and gzipped), which will reflect the latest version as soon as it is published to npm. You can also browse the source of the npm package at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/deskrt/.

Also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/deskrt@2.0.1/dist/loader.js).

For example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/deskrt@2.0.1/dist/loader.js"></script>
```

DeskRT demand loading SystemJS, Vue, Vuex, highlight.js, whatwg-fetch and ElementUI, but **DO NOT** reference these JS and CSS files. DeskRT will automatically reference. You only need to reference "loader.js".
